## ðŸ”¹ What is Cloud Computing? 
Cloud computing is the **delivery of computing services** (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet, instead of using local on-premises infrastructure. It allows businesses and individuals to access scalable and flexible resources on-demand.
### **Key Benefits of Cloud Computing:**
-  **Scalability** â€“ Easily scale resources up or down as needed.
-  **Cost-Effective** â€“ Pay only for what you use (no need for expensive hardware).
-  **Accessibility** â€“ Access your data and applications from anywhere.
-  **Security & Reliability** â€“ Cloud providers offer high levels of security and redundancy.

## ðŸ”¹ On-Premises vs. Cloud: How Do We Know If Something is in the Cloud?  

| Feature | On-Premises | Cloud |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Infrastructure** | Servers and hardware managed on-site | Hosted remotely by a cloud provider |
| **Maintenance** | Managed by an in-house IT team | Managed by the cloud provider |
| **Scalability** | Limited to available hardware | Easily scalable |
| **Cost Structure** | High upfront costs | Pay-as-you-go or subscription-based |
| **Accessibility** | Limited to local network | Accessible from anywhere via the internet |

**How to Check if a Service is in the Cloud?**  
- If the service is accessible **via a web browser or API**, it's likely cloud-based.  
- If there are **no physical servers to manage**, itâ€™s cloud computing.  
- If it's billed based on **usage (e.g., per hour, per request, or per user)**, it's cloud-based.
